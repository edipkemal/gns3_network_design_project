Firstly, I created buildings: factory, office, and branch office. 
I gave ip addresses for each building. 
In factory, every floor has a switch with 12 ports, and switches connected to each other. 
In office building, every office room has a switch and they connected to each other. 
Factory and office buildings connected with routers. 
At the beginning, I could not ping a pc in office from factory. 
Then I learnt that I should do “IP route” for routers. 
And also Ips of PCs’s should refer to gateway of routers. 
After these solutions I successfully ping each PC(You can see in screenshots). 
A PC in office building’s in first floor, is connected with brach office. 
Routers with serial ports provide this connection.
